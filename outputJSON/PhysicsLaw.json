Say you have a piece of aluminum foil stretched\ntightly across the top of a bowl, and then you put one lonely grape on top of it. Because of gravity, that grape is exerting\na little bit of force on the foil, and the normal force pushes right back, with the same\namount. But then you add another grape, which doubles the force on the foil -- in that case, the normal force doubles too. That’ll keep happening until eventually\nyou add enough grapes that they break through the foil.",
