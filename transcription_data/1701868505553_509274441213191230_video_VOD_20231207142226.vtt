00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.679
From a highly intelligent primate to a six legged avian ninja.

1
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.079
What would be the worst way to die?

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.520
Number three, the Asian giant hornet,

3
00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:16.350
also known as the Japanese hornet and recently dubbed the Murder Hornet.

4
00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:16.950
Oh,

5
00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:23.120
I mean of all the death by animal scenarios, I think being stung by murder hornets is

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.690
at the top

7
00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:28.569
and they do kill about 50 people a year in Japan on average

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.889
to be attacked by a swarm of Japanese hornets.

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.389
I couldn't imagine the pain.

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.240
One Japanese couple didn't have to imagine it

11
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:41.119
on a warm morning in September, Tau

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.189
and Koichi were gardening

13
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.950
when they disturbed a giant hornet nest.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.130
Within seconds, Koichi had a dozen massive insects attacking him.

15
00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.130
Each stinging repeatedly.

16
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.819
Taru was stung too as she ran for help.

17
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.970
My symptoms came quickly,

18
00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.740
my throat tightened up and I couldn't speak.

19
00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:05.790
Her

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.629
husband was completely engulfed by the hornets and stung all over his face and neck.

21
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.589
He blacked out

22
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.150
and the venom started to break down the tissues on his face.

23
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.050
He died within 15 minutes.

24
00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:25.389
These things can grow to around two inches. That's about this big

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.440
imagine something like this.

26
00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:32.839
An Avian ninja flying around with a sword on its backside coming after you.

27
00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:37.010
-- That is the stuff of nightmares
-- in one year,

28
00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:40.559
30 to 50 people in Asia die from these hornets

29
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.000
in the US. 60 to 80 people die from allergic reactions to various wasps and bees.

30
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.889
But somehow these giant hornets still scare us more

31
00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:53.300
when you get stung by a Japanese hornet.

32
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:54.900
That's a heck of a lot of venom that's being

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.959
injected and your body can go into full anaphylaxis.

34
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.639
And what happens is your blood pressure drops, your throat can swell,

35
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.699
it can be hard to breathe

36
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.540
and you can go into a full cardiac arrest,

37
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.788
but the hornets aren't after us.

38
00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.788
They want bees for dinner

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.710
and these insect predators are not staying in Asia.

40
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.850
-- So
-- this may sound like something out of a Hollywood horror movie we wish it was.

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.839
But Murder Hornets are a real thing and for the

42
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.190
first time they've been spotted here in the US.

43
00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.830
Unfortunately, Japanese hornets were recently released into Washington State

44
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.399
in British Columbia.

45
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.449
And that is a very high risk,

46
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.440
not only to the European honey bee that they like to attack,

47
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.289
but also to people who might happen upon a Japanese hornets nest.

48
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.839
So the hornets will actually decapitate the honey bees

49
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.089
and fly back to their nest with the bodies.

50
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.229
Why

51
00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.639
so that they can feed their babies,

52
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.160
beekeepers reporting

53
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.649
-- piles of dead bees. I mean, what's happening here?
-- This Asian giant hornet

54
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.690
that has a mandible that can just rip the head off of

55
00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.479
a honey bee and go through dozens of them in seconds.

56
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.259
They feed the thorax to their, to their offspring

57
00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.419
and then can take over that hive.

58
00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.820
Honey bees are our pollinators and have an invasive species.

59
00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:14.145
This come along at this time when they're

60
00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:17.264
reeling from colony collapse is really troubling.

61
00:03:17.274 --> 00:03:20.494
They describe the sting like being poked with a red hot plum

62
00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:23.505
tack through your flesh and it sting through a beekeeper's suit.

63
00:03:23.794 --> 00:03:26.955
Honey bees have had a tough go for a while with their varroa

64
00:03:26.964 --> 00:03:31.264
mites with fungal infections and now murder hornets are coming to get them.

65
00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:32.824
These guys can't get a break.

66
00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.820
-- And worst case scenario
-- if I had a swarm of Japanese hornets coming at me,

67
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.130
I think I'd like drop and roll.

68
00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.860
I think I'd really be trying to completely cover myself so that they couldn't get me.

69
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.679
You know, if there was a lake nearby,

70
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.820
I'd be in it

71
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.589
death by swarm of murder hornets. Not the way I wanna go.
